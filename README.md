# SlashBotLocalization
The localized strings of SlashBot

To contribute create a pull request with the language you want to add.
To request changes because of spelling or grammar mistakes also create a pull request editing that.

**FILES WHICH YOU CAN'T CREATE PULL REQUESTS FOR**
- TEMPLATE.json
- en.json
- AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES.json

These are the "template" files we use to add new languages since the bot is originally written in english and then translated to other languages
